OOP in PHP
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects" which contain data (properties) and code (methods) that operate on that data.

Benefits of OOP in PHP

Reusability:
Classes can be reused to create multiple objects, reducing code duplication.

Modularity:
Code is organized into self-contained units (objects), making it easier to manage and maintain.

Encapsulation:
Protects data from external access, enhancing security and data integrity.

Inheritance:
Creates hierarchical relationships between classes, promoting code reusability and extensibility.

Polymorphism:
Allows objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type, increasing flexibility.

Improved Code Organization:
Promotes better code structure and readability.

Scalability:
Easier to expand and modify applications without affecting existing code.
