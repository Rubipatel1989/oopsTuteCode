Testing in Laravel is typically done using PHPUnit and Laravelâ€™s 
built-in testing helpers. You can create test cases using the 
php artisan make:test command. Laravel provides features for testing 
various aspects of your application, including HTTP requests, 
database interactions, and console commands.
