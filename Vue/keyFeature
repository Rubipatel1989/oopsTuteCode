Answer:
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. 
Its key features include:

1. Reactive Data Binding: Ensures that the UI automatically updates when the data changes.
2. Components: Reusable and self-contained units of code.
3. Directives: Special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element.
4. Transitions/Animations: Provides ways to apply animations during DOM manipulation.
5. Templates: Combine the power of a declarative rendering system with the flexibility of JavaScript.
6. Vue CLI: A powerful tool for scaffolding and managing Vue.js projects.
Example:


<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>

<script>
  var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  });
</script>
