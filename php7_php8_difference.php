1. Performance: PHP 8 is generally faster than PHP 7 due to the introduction of the JIT 
    (Just-In-Time) compiler, which can significantly improve the performance of PHP code.

2. Union Types: PHP 8 added support for union types, allowing functions and methods to accept
     parameters that can be one of several different types.

3. Named Arguments: PHP 8 introduced named arguments, which allow you to specify 
    arguments by name when calling a function or method, making the code more readable and 
    reducing the chances of errors when the order of arguments is not clear.

4. Match Expression: PHP 8 introduced the match expression, which is similar to a 
    switch statement but with a more concise syntax and the ability to return a value.

5. Nullsafe Operator: PHP 8 added the nullsafe operator (?->), which allows 
    you to safely access properties and methods of an object without causing an error if the object is null.

6. Constructor Property Promotion: PHP 8 introduced constructor property 
    promotion, which allows you to declare and initialize class properties in a more 
    concise way in the class constructor.

7. Attributes: PHP 8 added support for attributes, which allow you to add metadata to classes, 
    properties, and methods in a more structured way than comments.

8. Error Handling Improvements: PHP 8 introduced several improvements to error handling, 
    including the addition of the Throwable interface, which is the base interface for all 
    exceptions and errors in PHP 8.
