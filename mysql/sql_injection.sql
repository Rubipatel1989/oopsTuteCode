SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate 
SQL queries sent to a database through a web application. This can allow the attacker to execute unauthorized 
SQL commands, access, modify, or delete data, and in some cases, take control of the database server.

To avoid SQL injection, you can follow these best practices:

1. Use Parameterized Queries: Instead of constructing SQL queries by concatenating strings, use parameterized 
    queries (also known as prepared statements) provided by your database library. Parameterized queries separate 
    the SQL code from the user input, preventing SQL injection attacks.
2. Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input on the server side. Ensure that user input matches the 
    expected format and does not contain malicious characters or commands. Use whitelisting (allowing only known 
    good inputs) rather than blacklisting (trying to filter out known bad inputs).
3. Avoid Dynamic SQL: Avoid using dynamic SQL where the structure of the query is determined by user input. 
    If dynamic SQL is necessary, ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized.
4. Least Privilege Principle: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to database users and applications. 
    This can limit the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
5. Update and Patch: Keep your database software and web application framework up to date with the latest 
    security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.
6 .Use Database Security Features: Use database features such as stored procedures, parameterized queries, 
    and database permissions to mitigate the risk of SQL injection.
7. Web Application Firewall (WAF): Consider using a WAF to help protect your web application from SQL 
    injection and other types of attacks.
