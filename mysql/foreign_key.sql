A foreign key constraint is a rule that enforces referential integrity within a relational 
database by establishing a relationship between two tables. Specifically, the foreign key
constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) of one table must match the 
corresponding values of the primary key column(s) in the related table.
