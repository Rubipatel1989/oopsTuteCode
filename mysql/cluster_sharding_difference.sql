Choosing between MySQL clustering and sharding depends on your specific 
requirements and the characteristics of your application. Here are some factors to consider:

Scalability:
Cluster: MySQL Cluster provides a more integrated and automatic approach to scaling, 
    making it easier to add nodes and distribute data.
Sharding: Sharding offers more flexibility in scaling horizontally, as you can add 
    shards independently. However, managing the shards and ensuring even distribution of 
    data can be more complex.

High Availability:
Cluster: MySQL Cluster has built-in high availability features, such as automatic 
    failover and data replication, making it well-suited for applications that require 
    high availability.
Sharding: High availability in sharding must be implemented at the application level, 
    which can be more complex and require more effort.

Complexity:
Cluster: MySQL Cluster is more integrated and provides a more seamless scaling 
    experience, which can reduce complexity, especially for applications that require 
    real-time performance and high availability.
Sharding: Sharding introduces additional complexity, as you need to manage the 
    shards, distribute data, and handle query routing at the application level or 
    using a sharding middleware.

Data Distribution:
Cluster: MySQL Cluster handles data distribution automatically, partitioning 
    data across nodes based on the shard key.
Sharding: With sharding, you have more control over how data is distributed 
    and can optimize data placement based on access patterns and workload characteristics.

Use Case:
Cluster: MySQL Cluster is well-suited for applications that require 
    high availability, real-time performance, and ACID compliance, such as 
    telecom networks, online gaming, and e-commerce.
Sharding: Sharding is suitable for applications with large datasets that 
    need to scale horizontally, such as social media platforms and content management systems
