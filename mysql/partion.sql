Partitioning in MySQL is a way to divide large tables into smaller, more manageable parts without having to split the tables themselves. This can improve query performance, simplify data management, and allow for easier maintenance.

There are several types of partitioning in MySQL:
Range : Data is divided based on a specified range of column values.
List : Data is divided based on a specified list of discrete values. For example, you could partition a table by country, with each partition containing data for a specific country.
Hash : Data is divided based on a hash value computed from one or more columns. This can be useful for distributing data evenly across partitions.
Key : Similar to hash partitioning, but the hash value is derived from a key value. This is often used with composite keys.
Composite : Combines two or more partitioning types. For example, you could use range partitioning on one column and hash

CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    sale_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    ...
    PRIMARY KEY (id, sale_date)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2010),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2011),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2012),
    ...
);
