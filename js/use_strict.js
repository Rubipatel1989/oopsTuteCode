// In JavaScript, 'use strict'; is a directive that enables strict mode, which is a 
// way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript that disallows some problematic 
// features and fixes bugs in the language. Strict mode helps you write more secure 
// and optimized JavaScript code by throwing errors for common coding mistakes that would 
// otherwise be ignored by the interpreter.

function myFunction() {
    'use strict';

    // Your JavaScript code here
}
